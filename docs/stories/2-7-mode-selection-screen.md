# Story 2-7: Learner Mode Selection Screen

Status: review

## Story

As a student who just uploaded a PDF,
I want to choose how deeply I want to study it (Deep / Balanced / Refresher) before generation starts,
so that the lesson HIE builds matches how much time and depth I actually want right now.

## Context

This is Sprint 2 task **S2-07** from `docs/dev2-sprint-tracker.md` §11 — the first of four new **Learner Mode** tasks (S2-07–S2-10) added 2026-07-14. Learner Mode is a brand-new feature with no prior PRD/epic coverage — it does not appear in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epic-2-lesson-player.md` or anywhere else. This story defines the feature's UI shape for the first time; later stories build on the decisions made here.

**Scope boundary (explicit, do not exceed):** this story is the mode-selection screen ONLY — the 3 cards, and gating progression on a selection. It does **not**:
- add tier disclaimer copy (that's **S2-08**, a separate story that will extend `ModeSelection.tsx`)
- send the selected tier to any backend endpoint (that's **S2-09** — `POST /api/content/lessons` has no tier field today, and adding one needs Dev 1 sign-off first; see below)
- show a tier badge anywhere in the player or session report (that's **S2-10**)

**Branch:** `sprint2/s2-7-mode-selection`, branched from `sprint1/s1-8-upload-real-api` (not `main` and not `sprint2-master`) — per user instruction, because that branch contains real, unmerged auth/upload backend-integration fixes (commits `f2dcc63`, `3f72ca4`, `306962b`) this feature sits directly on top of (it modifies the same `UploadFlow.tsx` those commits touched). Do not rebase onto `main` mid-story without re-confirming with the user; when this story is done it will need to flow through `sprint1/s1-8-upload-real-api` → `sprint2-master` → `main` in that order, not merge straight to `main`.

### What's already there to build on

- `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/upload/UploadFlow.tsx` — the real (non-mock) upload flow shipped in Story 1-8. Current state machine: `'idle' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'error'`. `handleFile(selectedFile)` validates the 50MB size limit, then **immediately** sets `uploadState('processing')`, which triggers a `useEffect` that calls `uploadService.uploadLesson(file)` followed by 5s-interval status polling. There is currently no pause between "file selected" and "upload POST fires."
- `apps/web/src/services/upload.service.ts` — `uploadService.uploadLesson(file: File)` posts multipart `FormData` with only a `file` field to `POST /api/content/lessons`. **No tier/mode field exists in this request today** — confirmed by reading the file directly, not assumed from docs. Adding one is explicitly out of scope here (S2-09).
- `apps/web/src/__tests__/components/dashboard/upload/UploadFlow.test.tsx` — 9 existing passing tests, all built around a `dropAFile()` helper that drops a file and then asserts `uploadLessonMock` was called directly, with no intervening step. **This story's own change (inserting a required mode-selection step between file-select and upload) will break every one of these tests as written** — this is an intentional, in-scope behavior change, not a regression to avoid. This story must update this test file's helper/tests to select a tier before asserting the upload call, not skip or delete coverage.
- `apps/web/src/types/assessment.ts` — existing precedent for where this codebase puts shared frontend types for a feature (used across multiple components/services). Follow this pattern for the new tier type rather than defining it inline in one component.

### Where in the flow this screen goes

Confirmed with the user: the mode-selection screen appears **after a file is chosen, before the actual upload POST fires** — not after the backend upload/generation completes. This lines up with **S2-09**'s own scope ("wire selected tier into `POST /lessons`; show chosen tier on the generating screen") — the tier has to be known before that POST is made, so it must be captured before `uploadLesson(file)` is called, not after.

Revised flow:
```
drop/select file → size-validated → [NEW] mode-selection screen (3 cards)
  → student picks a tier → upload POST fires → existing polling/processing screen → completed/error
```

Picking a card is both the selection and the confirmation — there is no separate "Continue" button. This keeps the screen a single decisive action, consistent with how `QuizOverlay`/`TeachBackModal` elsewhere in this codebase treat a click as final rather than staging a draft state.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **New shared tier type/data**, `apps/web/src/types/learnerMode.ts` (new file):
   - `export type LearnerTier = 'deep' | 'balanced' | 'refresher';`
   - `export interface LearnerTierOption { id: LearnerTier; label: string; description: string; }`
   - `export const LEARNER_TIER_OPTIONS: LearnerTierOption[]` — exactly 3 entries, in this order: `deep` ("Deep"), `balanced` ("Balanced"), `refresher` ("Refresher"), each with a one-sentence `description` (no disclaimer copy — that's S2-08). This is the canonical tier list S2-08/S2-09/S2-10 will also import, so later stories don't redefine it.
2. **New component**, `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/upload/ModeSelection.tsx`:
   - Props: `{ onSelect: (tier: LearnerTier) => void }`.
   - Renders exactly 3 cards, one per `LEARNER_TIER_OPTIONS` entry, each a real `<button>` (keyboard-focusable, matching this codebase's existing "Browse Files" button convention — not a `<div onClick>`).
   - Each card's visible text includes its `label` ("Deep" / "Balanced" / "Refresher") and `description`.
   - Clicking a card calls `onSelect(tier.id)` exactly once, with the correct tier id for that card.
3. **`UploadFlow.tsx` wiring:**
   - New state value `'selecting-mode'` added to the `uploadState` union (between `'idle'`-after-file-select and `'processing'`).
   - New state `selectedTier: LearnerTier | null` (component state — not yet persisted anywhere; S2-10 will decide where it needs to live long-term for the badge).
   - `handleFile` (after the existing size check passes): sets `file`, sets `uploadState('selecting-mode')`. It must **not** set `uploadState('processing')` directly anymore.
   - New handler `handleTierSelect(tier: LearnerTier)`: sets `selectedTier(tier)`, sets `uploadState('processing')`, sets `statusMessage('Uploading...')` — i.e. this is now what actually kicks off the existing upload effect (the effect's own trigger condition, `uploadState === 'processing' && file`, is unchanged).
   - New render branch for `uploadState === 'selecting-mode'`: renders `<ModeSelection onSelect={handleTierSelect} />` plus a text-link/button ("Choose a different file") that resets to `uploadState('idle')` — mirrors the existing "Generate Another"/"Try Again" back-to-idle pattern already used in the `completed`/`error` branches.
   - The oversized-file rejection path is unaffected (it sets `uploadState('error')` directly and never reaches `'selecting-mode'`).
4. **Existing upload flow behavior unchanged once a tier is picked** — everything from `handleTierSelect` onward (upload POST, polling, completed/error screens) is byte-for-byte the same as Story 1-8 shipped; this story does not touch `upload.service.ts` or the polling `useEffect`'s internals at all.
5. **Tests — new file** `apps/web/src/__tests__/components/dashboard/upload/ModeSelection.test.tsx`: renders 3 cards with the correct labels; clicking each one calls `onSelect` with the correct, distinct tier id (3 assertions, one per card).
6. **Tests — `UploadFlow.test.tsx` updated, not just left broken:**
   - Add a `selectTier(tierLabel: string)` test helper that clicks the named card's button.
   - New test: dropping a valid file shows the mode-selection screen (all 3 tier labels visible) and does **not** call `uploadLessonMock` yet.
   - Every existing test that currently calls `dropAFile()` and then expects `uploadLessonMock`/polling behavior must be updated to call `selectTier(...)` in between (pick any one tier — the choice doesn't affect these tests' assertions, since the upload call still only sends `file`, not tier, per AC-4).
   - New test: from the mode-selection screen, "Choose a different file" returns to the idle drop zone without ever calling `uploadLessonMock`.
   - The existing oversized-file-rejection test needs no change (it never reaches mode-selection).
7. **No regression to Story 1-8's own test suite**: full `apps/web` test suite still green after this story's changes (only the mode-selection-adjacent tests in `UploadFlow.test.tsx` should have actually changed).

## Dev Notes

### Files this story touches

- `apps/web/src/types/learnerMode.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/upload/ModeSelection.tsx` (NEW)
- `apps/web/src/__tests__/components/dashboard/upload/ModeSelection.test.tsx` (NEW)
- `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/upload/UploadFlow.tsx` (MODIFY — state union, `handleFile`, new `handleTierSelect`, new render branch)
- `apps/web/src/__tests__/components/dashboard/upload/UploadFlow.test.tsx` (MODIFY — see AC-6)
- `docs/dev2-sprint-tracker.md` (MODIFY — mark S2-07 done on completion)

### What NOT to do

- Do NOT send `selectedTier` to `upload.service.ts` / the backend in this story — there is no field for it yet, and wiring it is explicitly S2-09's job (needs Dev 1 sign-off on the request shape first).
- Do NOT add tier disclaimer text/styling to the cards — that's S2-08, a separate story that will extend this same `ModeSelection.tsx`. Keep `ModeSelection.tsx`'s current props/shape easy to extend (e.g. don't hardcode "no disclaimer slot" in a way that makes S2-08 need a rewrite), but don't build the disclaimer UI preemptively either.
- Do NOT add a tier badge to the player or session report — that's S2-10.
- Do NOT rewrite or "fix" the polling `useEffect` in `UploadFlow.tsx` — it is unmodified by this story; only the state transition that triggers it moves later (after tier selection instead of immediately after file selection).
- Do NOT delete or weaken existing `UploadFlow.test.tsx` coverage to make it pass faster — every test that broke because of this story's own behavior change must be fixed to reflect the new flow, not removed.
- Do NOT merge this branch to `main` directly when done — flows back through `sprint1/s1-8-upload-real-api`, then `sprint2-master`, per the branching convention confirmed 2026-07-14.

### Project Structure Notes

No conflicts with `packages/shared` frozen contracts (Learner Mode/tiers aren't part of any frozen schema yet — `LessonPackage`/`WsMessage` are untouched by this story). Purely additive: one new type module, one new component, one modified component with a new intermediate state, updated tests for the changed behavior.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 5 (claude-sonnet-5)

### Debug Log References

- Task 2 RED confirmed: `ModeSelection.test.tsx` failed with "Failed to resolve import '@/components/dashboard/upload/ModeSelection'" before the component existed; GREEN after implementing `ModeSelection.tsx` (4/4 tests passing).
- Task 3/4: no isolated RED step for `UploadFlow.tsx` itself — modifying it to insert the `'selecting-mode'` state intentionally broke all 9 pre-existing `UploadFlow.test.tsx` tests (each expected `uploadLessonMock` to fire immediately after `dropAFile()`), exactly as flagged in the story's own Context section. Fixed by updating the test file (Task 4) in the same pass; re-ran to confirm GREEN (11/11 passing).
- One test failure found and fixed during Task 4 that wasn't anticipated in the story: the new "Choose a different file" back-link test failed because the `'selecting-mode'` `motion.div` had an `exit` animation prop (`{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }`) — under `AnimatePresence mode="wait"`, this defers mounting the next (`'idle'`) child until the exit transition finishes, so a synchronous assertion right after the click still saw the old screen. Fixed by removing the `exit` prop from the `'selecting-mode'` block, matching the existing `'completed'`/`'error'` blocks (neither has an `exit` prop either — only `'idle'`/`'processing'` do, and those are only ever asserted on asynchronously via `waitFor`/`findBy` elsewhere in this file).

### Completion Notes List

- All 5 tasks completed; every AC in the story satisfied.
- Confirmed via direct file reads (not assumed from docs) before writing any code: `upload.service.ts`'s `uploadLesson(file)` has no tier parameter today, and `UploadFlow.tsx`'s pre-existing state machine went straight from file-select to `'processing'` with no intermediate step — both exactly as the story's Context section described.
- `selectedTier` component state (AC #3) is intentionally not consumed by anything in this story (S2-09/S2-10 will decide how). Left bare, this produced 1 new `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` warning (would have made the pre-existing 37-warning baseline 38 for the wrong reason — a genuinely dead variable, not tolerated pre-existing debt). Resolved by exposing it via a `data-selected-tier` attribute on the `'processing'` screen's root element — not rendered as visible text, so it doesn't affect any AC or existing test assertion, and gives S2-10 a ready hook. Final lint count is still 38 warnings, but all 38 are now the pre-existing kind, 0 new.
- Followed the story's explicit "picking a card is both selection and confirmation, no Continue button" design — kept `ModeSelection.tsx` to a single `onSelect` callback fired directly from each card's `onClick`.
- Did not touch `upload.service.ts`, the polling `useEffect`'s internals, tier disclaimers, or any player/report code — all explicitly out of scope per the story's "What NOT to do" section.
